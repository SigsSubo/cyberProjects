Lab Purpose: To create and evaluate hash values for files using Linux commands in order to determine if the files are same or different. 

In the home directory there are two files file1.txt and file2.txt, which contain same data.

My tasks are: 

Task 1: Generate hashes for files
- List the contents of the /home/analyst directory using the ls command.
- Display the contents of file1.txt using the cat command.
- Display the contents of file2.txt using the cat command.
- Determine if the contents of file1.txt and file2.txt appear identical based on the cat output.
- Generate a hash for file1.txt using the sha256sum command.
- Generate a hash for file2.txt using the sha256sum command.
- Review the generated hash values for both files.
- Determine if the hash values for file1.txt and file2.txt are the same.

Task 2: Compare hashes
- Generate the hash of file1.txt using sha256sum and write it to a new file called file1hash.
- Generate the hash of file2.txt using sha256sum and write it to a new file called file2hash.
- Display the contents of file1hash using the cat command.
- Display the contents of file2hash using the cat command.
- Manually inspect and note the differences between the hash values in file1hash and file2hash.
- Use the cmp command to compare file1hash and file2hash byte by byte.
- Review the output of the cmp command to identify where the first difference occurs.
